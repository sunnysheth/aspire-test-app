## About Code Challenge
This challenge is given by <a href="https://aspireapp.com/" target="_blank">Aspire</a> as a part of candidate selection process.<br />
The challenge states to build a mini-aspire API.</p>
Its specification is: <br /> 
It is an app that allows authenticated users to go through a loan application. It doesn’t have to contain too many fields, but at least “amount
required” and “loan term.” All the loans will be assumed to have a “weekly” repayment frequency.<br />
After the loan is approved, the user must be able to submit the weekly loan repayments. It can be a simplified repay functionality, which won’t
need to check if the dates are correct but will just set the weekly amount to be repaid.
        
Application is built using <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>
    

## Installation Steps
After checkout, several commands needs to be executed to setup this project.
    
    composer install
After installation, we need to get and setup .env file using command:
    
    sudo cp .env.example .env
Once we have .env file, we have to setup application key using command:
    
    php artisan key:generate
Now, you have to create a database blank database and configure database into our .env file over this commands:
Here, you have to provide your details for `database`, `username`, `password`.
    
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=<your db-name>
    DB_USERNAME=<mysql user name>
    DB_PASSWORD=<mysql password>

Please run this below command in order to setup the project. 

    php artisan project:init

This command will be responsible for executing Migrations, Setup passport configuration, autoload all resources and optimize the project.
Since we have integrated Passport for generation of authentication token over APIs, we have to publish Passport vendor and generate keys.
    
To run the project:
    
    php artisan serve --port=<your_custom_port> --host=<custom_host>
Here, `--port` and `--host` are optional parameters. If we do not provide host, it taken `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` by default. And default port is `8000` (if it is free)
    
## Further documentation for functionalities:

All routes related to this mini-aspire API are located in `routes/api.php` file.
